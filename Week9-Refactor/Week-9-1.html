        <p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation,
          conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now
          we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived
          and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come
          to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives
          that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in
          a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave
          men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or
          detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget
          what they did here. It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work
          which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here
          dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased
          devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here
          highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall
          have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people
          shall not perish from the earth.</p>

		<p>Fans, for the past two weeks you have been reading about a bad break I got. Yet today I consider
          myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth. I have been in ballparks for seventeen years
          and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans.
          Look at these grand men. Which of you wouldn't consider it the highlight of his career to
          associate with them for even one day? Sure, I'm lucky. Who wouldn't consider it an honor to have
          known Jacob Ruppert - also the builder of baseball's greatest empire, Ed Barrow - to have spent
          the next nine years with that wonderful little fellow Miller Huggins - then to have spent the
          next nine years with that outstanding leader, that smart student of psychology - the best manager
          in baseball today, Joe McCarthy! Sure, I'm lucky. When the New York Giants, a team you would
          give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift, that's something! When everybody
          down to the groundskeepers and those boys in white coats remember you with trophies, that's
          something. When you have a wonderful mother-in-law who takes sides with you in squabbles against
          her own daughter, that's something. When you have a father and mother who work all their lives
          so that you can have an education and build your body, it's a blessing! When you have a wife who
          has been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed, that's the finest I
          know. So I close in saying that I might have had a tough break - but I have an awful lot to live
          for! </p>

		<p>I could not have blamed you for being the first to lose heart if I, your commander, had not
		shared in your exhausting marches and your perilous campaigns; it would have been natural enough
		if you had done all the work merely for others to reap the reward. But it is not so. You and I,
		gentlemen, have shared the labour and shared the danger, and the rewards are for us all. The
		conquered territory belongs to you; from your ranks the governors of it are chosen; already the
		greater part of its treasure passes into your hands, and when all Asia is overrun, then indeed I
		will go further than the mere satisfaction of our ambitions: the utmost hopes of riches or power
		which each one of you cherishes will be far surpassed, and whoever wishes to return home will be
		allowed to go, either with me or without me. I will make those who stay the envy of those who
		return.</p>

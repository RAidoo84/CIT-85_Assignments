    <h1>My Suggestion</h1>
    <p>If it is not pertinent or not doable in HTML, don't cover.</p>
    <p>The covering of new upcoming stuff is making this class more difficult than it has to be.</p>
    <p>And stop rambling and going off in tangents. I had to stop listening because I could never</p>
    <p>figure out what the bejeezus you were talking about.</p>
